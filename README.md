New discord bot code by Kiki

After cloning run the [RUN_THIS_AFTER_CLONING.py](RUN_THIS_AFTER_CLONING.py) script.

As the script says, don't forget to then edit config.json

Start up the bot with `sh scripts/start.sh`

Stop the bot with `sh scripts/stop.sh`

Or if you're using the bot locally for __development__ purposes then just simply start the bot by running the `main_d3.py` script.
